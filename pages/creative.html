                <hr>
                <p>
                    Here is a photograph I took for my TMFD 121 course. In the photograph, you can see my friend 
                    meticulously lining up a shot to hit the final 8 ball. The photograph was taken in the recreational 
                    center at the Nebraska Union. The blur within the photo adds a sense of depth to the audience's focus 
                    and places more emphasis on the 8-ball while my blurred friend in the background provides additional context. 
                    The color grading was done through photoshop and was edited with the intention of a cinematic tone.

                    Here is another photograph I took for my TMFD 121 course. In the photograph, you can observe my friend working 
                    on an assignment for a class. This photograph was taken in the recreational center at the Nebraska Union. 
                    The many objects (notebook, calculator, laptop) scattered in the photograph indicates and provides context for 
                    a hardworking student. This photograph was taken during the time where COVID was more apparent; thus, my friend 
                    was wearing a mask. The photograph was edited through photoshop and the color grade was made with cinematic intentions.

                <h2>Poster For A Theater Play</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Here is a poster I created to advertise a play called &#8220A Midsummer Night's Dream&#8221;. 
                    All the graphics in the poster were manually created by myself. I drew inspiration from minimalistic 
                    art and utilized vector elements to create a minimalist appeal in the subjects apparent in the poster. 
                    I tried to keep my color scheme to a limited amount of colors with an emphasis on shades of red.
